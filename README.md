# Smart Tourism Management System
___

## 1. Introduction
Planning a trip in Sri Lanka is currently chaotic. Tourists are forced to rely on scattered sources like blogs, outdated websites, and random messages to guides. This fragmentation creates a **"Trust Deficit"**—users don't know if pricing is fair or if information is accurate.

Our solution is a **Centralized Decision-Support Platform** that consolidates itinerary planning, verified service providers, and reviews into one reliable ecosystem.

## 2. Solution Architecture
We are building a web-based MVP focused on trust and usability:
* **Frontend:** React.js for an interactive Itinerary Planner.
* **Backend:** Node.js (Express) for scalable API handling.
* **Database:** MySQL (Relational) to manage complex relationships between Tourists, Guides, and Itineraries.

## 3. Key Features
* **Interactive Itinerary Planner:** Drag-and-drop interface to build custom trips.
* **Verified Guide Portfolios:** A system where guides display credentials and vehicle details, verified by admins to ensure safety.
* **Review System:** Community-driven ratings for destinations and guides.
